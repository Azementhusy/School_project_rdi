                Do you have a rare disease or a rare cancer? <br />
                Do you have a family member living with a rare disease? <br />
                How are you or your family member participating in day-to-day activities? <br />

                This survey will take around 10 minutes to complete.  <br />
                It will help Rare Diseases Ireland, the national alliance for rare disease patient organisations in Ireland to advocate for people living with rare diseases.  <br />
                The overall survey results will be made publicly available.  <br />
                Your answers will not be published. Your answers will be kept in secure storage, which only the research team can access.

                If you have any questions, you can contact the Rare Diseases Ireland at advocacy @rdi.ie  <br />
